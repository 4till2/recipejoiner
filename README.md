This project began as a conversation between friends. "Why are we still savagely sharing recipes via text? And worst, reading recipe creators full life story when we just want to make dinner!". This repo is the MVP resulting from that conversation. It is fully functional, though there are chores to be done before production grade usage. The main objective here is proof of concept.
